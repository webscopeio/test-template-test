# Your shiny new repository with questions

This is an example `INTRODUCTION.md` file. Everytime you update questions in this repository this document will be
concatenated with automatically exported questions and stored into `README.md`.

‚ùóÔ∏è Because `README.md` is always overwritten automatically, you should use this document if you want to add a custom
message that will be persisted even after you update your questions.

## Usage

- Update your questions in [questions.yaml](/questions.yaml) file.
- Run `hire-dev lint` to lint this file for possible errors.
    - Alternatively you can use `hire-dev lint --watch` that lint [questions.yaml](/questions.yaml) automatically.
- After lint command succeeded you can use `hire-dev markdown` to export your questions to the `README.md`
  file (`INTRODUCTION.md` will be used as a header of `README.md`).
- That's it! Now you can use this repository with [Hire.dev](https://hire.dev/). ü•≥

Thank you for using [Hire.dev](https://hire.dev/), we hope you'll enjoy the experience üòå
